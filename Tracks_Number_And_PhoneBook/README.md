# **Track Number & PhoneBook**


## **About**
This project is a Python-based application designed to manage a phone book and track phone numbers. It allows users to add, search, update, and delete contact details, including phone numbers, emails, and addresses.  

The application features phone number tracking to determine the geographical location of contacts using external APIs. A user-friendly graphical interface, built with **Tkinter**, enhances interaction, making it easy to manage and track contact information effectively.  


## **Overview**
1. Designing this Python-based application involves:  
- Storing contact details  
- Searching, updating, and deleting contacts  
- Integrating phone number tracking using the **phonenumbers** library  
- Optionally enhancing functionality with APIs like **OpenCage Geocode** for improved location accuracy  

2. A GUI designed with **Tkinter** ensures a seamless and intuitive user experience.
